      <h2>Surviving the Desert Storm</h2>
      <div class="story">
        <p>It was supposed to be a fun trip. My uncle, a photographer, invited me to join him on a journey to the Sahara Desert. He said we would take photos of sand dunes and camels. I was so excited. But things didn't go as planned.</p>

        <p>On the third day of the trip, while exploring far from our base camp, a huge sandstorm suddenly hit. The sky turned orange and the wind blew hard, making it almost impossible to see. I held my scarf tight over my face, but the sand stung my skin like needles. My uncle shouted, "Stay close!" but the wind was too loud—I couldn't hear him. In just seconds, we were separated.</p>

        <p>I tried to walk in the direction I thought was right, but I soon realized I was completely lost. There was no phone signal, and the sun was starting to set. My water bottle was half full, and I had no food. I knew I had to stay calm. I found a large rock and sat behind it to block the wind. I remembered what I learned from a survival show—move as little as possible, save water, and look for shelter.</p>

        <p>That night, the desert was freezing. I used my scarf as a blanket and tried to sleep, but the cold kept me awake. The next morning, I looked for signs—footprints, camel tracks—anything. After walking for hours under the hot sun, I saw something shiny in the distance.</p>

        <p>It was our camp's solar panel! I ran with the little energy I had left and shouted for help. My uncle and the guide found me just in time. I was weak and tired, but safe. That moment taught me that nature is beautiful but also dangerous. Since then, I always prepare better for every trip. Surviving that night in the desert made me stronger and more thankful for simple things like water, warmth, and family.</p>
