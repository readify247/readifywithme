    <h2>A Day with a Flat Tire</h2>

    <p>One sunny afternoon, a boy named Arif decided to ride his bike to the park. He had been looking forward to this all week. As he rode down the street, he felt the wind in his hair and the warmth of the sun on his face. It was the perfect day for a bike ride.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Arif heard a loud hissing sound. He stopped and looked down to see his front tire going flat. His heart sank. He was still far from the park and didn't have a spare tube or pump with him.</p>

    <p>Feeling a bit helpless, Arif walked his bike to the side of the road. He remembered his father's advice to always stay calm and think of a solution. Arif decided to walk his bike back home, even though it was a long way.</p>

    <p>On his way back, Arif saw his neighbor, Mr. Hasan, working in his garden. Mr. Hasan noticed Arif's flat tire and called out, "Do you need some help?" Relieved, Arif explained what had happened. Mr. Hasan smiled and invited him into his garage.</p>

    <p>Mr. Hasan had all the tools needed to fix the flat tire. He showed Arif how to remove the wheel, find the hole, and patch it up. Arif watched carefully, grateful for the help. Within a short time, the tire was as good as new.</p>

    <p>Arif thanked Mr. Hasan and happily rode his bike home. He had learned something valuable that day: always be prepared and never hesitate to ask for help when needed. Despite the flat tire, it turned out to be a good day after all.</p>
