      <h2>My Football Experience</h2>
      <p>Hello, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andre Detrio. You can call me Andre. I would like to tell you about my football experience. It was at my Junior High School time. As I knew, when I was at eight grades, I followed the football extracurricular. I had to practice how to be a good soccer player every Friday and Sunday. My coach was Mr. Alex. He was so kind and funny.</p>

      <p>Every letter about soccer champion, he asked and guided the students to follow. Winning or failing champion was not the priorities according to him. The most important for us was that we could know the real competition with another team from another school.</p>

      <p>Talking about my football experience, there was a football competition in my school. He announced to all and asked us to practice hard. He promised if we got the first winner, we would go to the beach.</p>

      <p>The competition was scheduled in the beginning of August. We were so nervous and along the competition we faced many teams. At the end of the competition, the master of ceremony announced that our team was the first winner. We were so happy.</p>

      <p>The coach celebrated our win and gave us the holiday to the beach next Sunday. That moment is my unforgettable football experience.</p>
