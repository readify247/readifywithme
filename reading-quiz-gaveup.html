      <h2>The Day I Almost Gave Up</h2>
      <div class="story">

        <p>When I was in junior high school, I experienced something I will never forget. It happened during my second year. At first, everything felt normal. I had a few friends, and I enjoyed my classes. But one day, everything changed.</p>

        <p>A group of older students started making fun of me. It began with simple jokes about my appearance. I tried to ignore them, but the teasing became worse. They started calling me names in the hallway and laughing loudly whenever I passed by. I felt embarrassed, angry, and alone. I didn't tell anyone at first because I was afraid things would get worse.</p>

        <p>The worst moment happened after school. I was walking home when the group followed me and took my backpack. They threw it into a muddy puddle and laughed while I stood there, shocked and helpless. I remember going home in tears, feeling like I didn't belong anywhere.</p>

        <p>That night, I thought about quitting school. I had no motivation and was afraid to face them again. But then my older sister noticed something was wrong. She asked me gently, and I finally opened up to her. She immediately told our parents, and together we spoke to my school counselor the next day.</p>

        <p>The school took it seriously. The bullies were given punishment and had to attend a counseling program. Slowly, I started feeling safe again. I joined a writing club and made new friends who supported me. That experience taught me that speaking up is not a weakness — it's a way to protect yourself and others.</p>

        <p>Now, whenever I see someone being bullied, I try my best to help. I don't want anyone else to feel the way I did.</p>
