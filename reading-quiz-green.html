    <h2>The Green Hero</h2>
    <div class="story">

      <p>Once upon a time in a quiet village called Wana Lestari, there lived a 13-year-old boy named Bima. He was known among his friends as a curious and kind-hearted student. Bima loved nature. He often spent his free time exploring the forest near his school, watching birds and collecting leaves to study.</p>

      <p>One day, Bima noticed something strange. The river near his village, once clean and full of fish, had turned brown and smelly. Plastic bottles, food wrappers, and garbage floated everywhere. He felt sad and worried. “What happened to our beautiful river?” he asked himself.</p>

      <p>Bima couldn’t ignore it. The next day, he spoke to his teacher and suggested starting a “Green Patrol” team. Some friends joined him; together, they made posters and asked people not to throw trash into the river. They even organized a cleaning day. At first, not everyone supported them. Some friends laughed and said, “You’re just kids!”</p>

      <p>But Bima and his friends didn’t give up. Week after week, they cleaned the river and educated others. Slowly, more people joined them. In three months, the river looked much better. Fish started to return, and children could play by the riverside again.</p>

      <p>From that day on, Bima was called The Green Hero of Wana Lestari. He proved that age didn’t matter when someone wanted to make a change. His story inspired other schools to start their own Green Patrol teams across the region.</p>
