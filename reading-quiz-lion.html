      <h2>The Lion and The Mouse</h2>
      <div class="story">
        <p>On a warm summer afternoon, deep inside a thick green forest, a mighty lion lay resting under the shade of a tall tree. He had just eaten a large meal and was enjoying a peaceful nap. The forest was quiet, broken only by the sound of rustling leaves and distant birdsong.</p>

        <p>Suddenly, a tiny mouse appeared from a hole near the tree roots. The mouse scurried across the forest floor searching for food, and by accident, ran over the lion’s huge paw. The lion awoke with a thunderous roar that echoed through the trees. In an instant, he trapped the small creature beneath his sharp claws.</p>

        <p>“Who dares to disturb my sleep?” the lion growled. Trembling with fear, the mouse squeaked, “Please, mighty lion, spare my life. I did not mean to wake you. If you let me go, I promise that one day I will repay your kindness.”</p>

        <p>The lion laughed at such a bold promise. “How could a small creature like you ever help a powerful king like me?” he said with amusement. But something in the mouse’s courage touched his heart. Choosing mercy, the lion lifted his paw and set the mouse free. “Go,” he said. “But remember your promise.”</p>

        <p>Weeks later, while patrolling his territory, the lion stepped into a hunter’s trap — a strong net hidden beneath leaves. The ropes tightened around his legs and chest. He roared and struggled with all his strength, but the more he fought, the tighter the net became. For the first time, the mighty lion felt helpless.</p>

        <p>From a distance, the mouse heard the desperate roars and recognized the lion’s voice. Without hesitation, she hurried toward the sound. There she found the lion, proud and mighty but caught and powerless. “Do not worry, my friend,” said the mouse. “I will help you, just as I promised.”</p>

        <p>Using her sharp teeth, she began gnawing at the ropes. It was slow, hard work, but the mouse did not give up. Bit by bit, the ropes weakened until they finally snapped. At last, the lion was free again. He stretched his body and looked down at the little mouse with deep gratitude.</p>

        <p>“Thank you,” said the lion humbly. “Today you have saved my life. I was wrong to think that your size made you powerless. Even the smallest creature can do something mighty.”</p>

        <p>From that day forward, the lion and the mouse became unlikely friends. They often walked through the forest together, teaching others that kindness, humility, and keeping promises are the true measures of strength.</p>

        <p><strong>Moral:</strong> No act of kindness is ever wasted. Even the smallest friend can make a big difference.</p>
