      <h2>My Experience in Porseni</h2>
      <div class="story">

        <p>Last year in December, my school held a sports event called Porseni. On that day, all classes prepared their best students in sports and arts, including my class. We worked together to improve and decorate our garden and classroom in order to be the best in the upcoming Porseni. One week before the event, we prepared by adding grass to the garden to make it look greener and cooler. We also cleaned our classroom thoroughly.</p>

        <p>The event finally took place at 6:30 a.m. I wore my costume made from newspapers. All the students decided to wear the same style of costume to make the celebration more attractive. We did a parade around our town, Bone. This tour is called the Devile Parade. After the parade, we returned to school. My body felt tired, but we were excited to learn that we won second place among all classes. We celebrated together with joy.</p>

        <p>On the second day, there were several sports competitions, such as takraw ball, volleyball, tug of war, and basketball. Luckily, my class played in the first round for each game. The results were excellent because all of our teams made it to the second round. The second day ended at 3 p.m., and all team members were asked to rest well for the next day.</p>

        <p>On the third day, unfortunately, our basketball team lost the match against the eleventh-grade team. The game was very intense and the score was very close. However, a mistake happened in the last minute. One member accidentally passed the ball to the opponent, and they scored the final point. The referee blew the whistle and ended the match.</p>

        <p>Day by day, our teams kept losing. Maybe we had less experience compared to other classes. However, we were not too disappointed. At least, we became the second winner in the parade contest. I hope that next year we can win more matches.</p>
